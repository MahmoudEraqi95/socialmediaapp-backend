# 📱🌐 Social Media Backend — Offline-First Architecture Demo

This project is a **Node.js + Express backend** built to demonstrate how a **modern Offline-First architecture** works in both **Android clients** and the **Backend ecosystem**.

It supports features commonly found in social media apps—**posts, likes, comments, user profiles**—while focusing on how data is handled **when the device is offline**, **how syncing works**, and **how conflicts are resolved**.
